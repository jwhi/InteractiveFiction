Testing the foundation of a text adventure written in Java with Slick2D and LWJGL.

Using the Stanford Log-linear Part-Of-Speech Tagger to identify the verb and noun of sentence for commands.

Using images from various authors on OpenGameArt.org.

A portion of an image by Kevin Chaoloux as the sky background.

I do not have permission to give out rights for any of the current art assets and all questions about them should be referred to their original authors.

This is only a project I am working on my free time so no promises in any sort of completion.
